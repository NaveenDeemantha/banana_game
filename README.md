## Banana Game

Welcome to Banana Game – a lightweight, arcade-style web game crafted with Vue.js and PHP, powered by the Banana API. Players race against the clock to solve on-the-fly math challenges and collect as many bananas as possible across three intensity levels.

This project serves both as a fun demo and a hands-on learning experience: explore game loops, API integration, dynamic UI with Vue, timer management and backend logic in PHP. Perfect for building your frontend skills, experimenting with interactive gameplay in the browser—and sparking ideas for your next mini-project.

Key features:

Real-time math problems delivered via Banana API

Multiple difficulty levels with shortening time limits

Clean, modular Vue.js code with reusable components

PHP backend handling challenge generation and scoring

Simple interface ready for extension or theme-customisation

Feel free to clone the repo, tweak the graphics, add new mechanics or integrate your own API – and don’t hesitate to drop suggestions or improvements!
